    <h2>Brown Crocodile</h2>
    <p>
        Crocodiles are large semiaquatic reptiles that live throughout the tropics in Africa, Asia, the
         Americas and Australia. Crocodylinae, all of whose members are considered true crocodiles, is 
         classified as a biological subfamily. A broader sense of the term crocodile, Crocodylidae 
         is not used in this article. The term crocodile here applies to only the species within the 
         subfamily of Crocodylinae. The term is sometimes used even more loosely to include all extant 
         members of the order Crocodilia, which includes the alligators and caimans (family Alligatoridae)
         ,the gharial and false gharial (family Gavialidae), and all other living and fossil 
         Crocodylomorpha.
