    <h2> Batmanton </h2>
<p>In my Childhood i usually like to play Batmanton because it is one of activity that i can be active.
    The game developed in British India from the earlier game of <b>battledore and shuttlecock</b>.
     European play came to be dominated by <b>Denmark</b> but the game has become very popular in Asia, 
     with recent competitions dominated by China. Since 1992, badminton has been a Summer Olympic sport 
     with four events: men's singles, women's singles, men's doubles, and women's doubles, with mixed 
     doubles added four years later. At high levels of play, the sport demands excellent <b>fitness: 
     players require aerobic stamina, agility, strength, speed, and precision</b>. It is also a technical
      sport, requiring good motor coordination and the development of sophisticated racquet movements.</p>
